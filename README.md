# Automated Detection and Security Assessment (ADSA)
### 

This project automates the process of generating a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) report by parsing Nmap and Nikto scan results and creating a professional PDF report. The tool extracts important details such as open and filtered ports, services, vulnerabilities, and recommendations, and formats them into a well-structured report using the `reportlab` library.

#### Key Features:
- **Nmap and Nikto Parsing**: Extracts open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
- **Report Generation**: Creates a PDF report with details such as host information, scan summaries, vulnerability assessment, and recommendations.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different scan outputs and report formats.

#### Usage:
Provide the directory containing the Nmap and Nikto scan results, and the script will output a complete PDF report.
